Algorand Hackathon 
Idea:

 - Many exciting multiplayer and heads up internet games would be prime targets for contests and tournaments which could be monetized. This of course is already being done, but the down-side of centralization is obvious. 
   - had all my money frozen playing online poker
   - paypal banned me for facilitating token purchases
   - sites go bankrupt
   - sketchy payment processors
- People who run DFS applications or poker tournaments want to focus on the user experience of their game.
  - They require trust from their users to hold their money.
  - The centralized escrow type services for Daily Fantasy Sports charge a prohibitive amount to those who like to play for money but for micro amounts.
  - ngl helps circumvent draconian legal jurisdictions which fail to categorize games of skill as just that.
