### Challenge Description

This challenge is focused on building an application that functions as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO should support both raising capital and voting by DAO members on allocations or changes to the DAO. The exact interest of the DAO is not specified, but could be for things like investing in real estate, NFT pools, startup companies or similar ideas. The DAO should also provide user interfaces for proposals and the voting process as well as new member acceptance.
